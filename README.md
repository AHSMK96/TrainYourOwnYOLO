# TrainYourOwnYOLO: Building a Custom Image Detector from Scratch

This repo let's you train a custom image detector using the state-of-the-art YOLOv3 computer vision algorithm. For a short write up check out this [medium post](www.medium.com). 

### Pipeline Overview

To build and test your object detection algorithm follow the below steps:

 1. [Image Annotation](/1_Image_Annotation/)
	 - Install Microsoft's Visual Object Tagging Tool (VoTT)
	 - Annotate images
 2. [Training](/2_Training/)
 	- Download pre-trained weights
 	- Train your custom model on annotated images 
 3. [Inference](/3_Inference/)
 	- Detect objects in new images
## Repo structure
+ [`1_Image_Annotation`](/1_Image_Annotation/): Contains all Information to annotate images
+ [`2_Training`](/2_Training/): Training of your YOLOv3 model
+ [`3_Inference`](/3_Inference/): Testing your trained model on new data
+ [`Data`](/Data/): Input Data, Output Data, Model Weights and Results

## Getting Started

### Requisites
The code uses python 3.6, Keras with Tensorflow backend. For training it is recommened to us a GPU. For example on an AWS you can use a *p2.xlarge* instance (Tesla K80 GPU with 12GB memory). Inference is generally even fast on a CPU with an average of ~2 images per second. 


### Installation [Linux or Mac]

#### Clone Repo and Install Requirements
Clone this repo with:
```
git clone https://github.com/AntonMu/TrainYourOwnYOLO
cd TrainYourOwnYOLO/
```
Create Virtual Environment ([Venv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) needs to be installed on your system). 
```
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```
Next, install all required packages. If you are running TrainYourOwnYOLO on a machine with GPU with CUDA drivers installed run:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Otherwise, run:
```
pip3 install -r requirements_cpu.txt
```

## Quick Start (Inference only)
If you just want to test out the cat face detector on a few test images located in [`Data/Source_Images/Test_Images`](/Data/Source_Images/Test_Images) run the `Minimal_Example.py` script with:

```
python Minimal_Example.py
```

The outputs are saved in [`Data/Minimal_Example`](/Data/Minimal_Example). This includes:
 - Cat pictures with bounding boxes around faces with confidence scores
 - \*.csv file with file names and locations of bounding boxes

## Full Start (Training and Inference)

To also train your model, follow the individual instructions located in [1_Image_Annotation](/1_Image_Annotation/), [2_Training](/2_Training/) and [3_Inference](/3_Inference/), respectively.

## Common Issues

If you are having trouble with getting cv2 to run, try:

```
apt-get update
apt-get install -y libsm6 libxext6 libxrender-dev
pip install opencv-python
```

If you are using Linux you can are having trouble installing `*.snap` package files try:
```
snap install - dangerous vott-2.1.0-linux.snap
```
